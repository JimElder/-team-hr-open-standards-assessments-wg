REPO for HR Open Standards - Assessment Work Group - Spring 2020

The HR Open Standards - Assessments Work Group has joined with the Spring 2020 xAPI Cohort to facilitate discussions on the incorporation of xAPI terms and definitions into the HR Open Standards structure. We are awaiting the release of the Assessments profile in October 2020 by the IEEE, and will use that profile as our starting point.
